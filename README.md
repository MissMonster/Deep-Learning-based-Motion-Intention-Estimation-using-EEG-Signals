# Deep-Learning-based-Motion-Intention-Estimation-using-EEG-Signals
This code is written to estimate Human Motion Intention using Deep Learning (Artificial Neural Network). I have used 61 Channel EEGs. The data was obtained from BNCI Website (http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets). The dataset description is also uploaded.
